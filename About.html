    <h2>Ms. Patty</h2>    
        <p class="bigfont">Patrese has over 20 years of experience in child care. As a young adult, her mother and grandmother became foster parents and she assisted in the daily duties of takting care of her new family members. Throughout the years, her mother and grandmother fostered kids of various ages for various periods of time (depending on the needs of the child). From a 9 month old baby to pre-teens and teenagers (10-14), Patrese has learned the stages of child development. In addition to real world experience, Patrese received a Bachelor's of Science degree in Psychology and a Master's degree in Early Childhood Education. She worked at a day care center for 5 years while also researching and planning for this business. Thankful to have this opportunity, Patrese and her staff treat every child with dignity, love and respect. We hope that you and your children feel at home at Patty's Conscious Care Child Center.  </p>
